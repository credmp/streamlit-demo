#+title: Hacking notes

These are the notes of NOVI Hogeschool. We host the hack friday and from there these commands are the most favorite in their category:

* Host file editing

There is only one tool for the job: ~hed add loempia.htb 123.231.132.9~

* Scanning

Our favorite scanning command: ~nmap -sVC loempia.htb~

* Content discovery

Always use feroxbuster: ~feroxbuster --url loempia.htb~

* VHost discovery

There is nothing better then gobuster: ~gobuster vhost -u loempia.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --append-domain~
